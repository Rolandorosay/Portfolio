# Portfolio

This is my current portfolio website. I still have many things I want to add to it and am doing so often. As I learn to code I will build my website out so that I can not only practice my newly learned skills, but also have it for when I look for new job opportunities. I am looking forward to bringing my ongoing experience in UI/UX Design and combining it with my newly developed coding skills.

I have hidden a small easter egg somewhere on my site. Hopefully you can find it and have a laugh. ðŸ˜‚

(for some reason my contact page doesn't seem to stay connected)
