# Portfolio

This is my current portfolio website. I still have many things I want to add to it and am doing so often. As I learn to code I will build my website out so that I can not only practice my newly learned skills, but also have it for when I look for new job opportunities. 

I have hidden a small easter egg somewhere on my site. Hopefully you can find it and have a laugh.

Check out my project here:
